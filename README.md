| parameter name  | default value | usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `batch_size`    | 256           | Batch size used during pre-training. According to the original Barlow Twins paper, model performance improves considerably with bigger batch sizes. However, using 4 Tesla V100 GPUs (each with 32 GB of VRAM), the largest batch size we have achieved is 256. |
| `lr_base`       | 1e-3          | The base learning rate used for encoder training; it determines the highest value the `WarmUpCosine` scheduler reaches.                                                                                                                                         |
| `weight_decay`  | 1.5e-6        | Determines the weight decay value if using a LAMB optimizer.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `cifar_resnet`  | False         | If set to `True`, the Barlow Twins encoder will be a ResNet18 designed for the CIFAR dataset; otherwise, the encoder will be a ResNet50v2. They have about 9 million and 40 million parameters, respectively.                                                   |
| `projector_dim` | 2048          | Dimensionality of the projector network in Barlow Twins. Note that this does not change the output feature vector size of the encoder network.                                                                                                                  |
| `filter_size`   | 23            | The size of the Gaussian filter used during preprocessing. A higher value is more computationally expensive and has a concrete impact on training time.                                                                                                         |
